## PCB Design

Designing the PCB has taken a few iterations throughout the course of the project

## HX711 PCB

Template files available on Eagle were used to design the PCB for the HX711 ADC, this circuit was used to test the HX711 with the 
code for the scales. It reads out the information from the load cells and outputs the data to the command terminal on the raspberry pi.
